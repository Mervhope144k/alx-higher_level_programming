A. High-level-programming

B. What Does High-Level Language Mean

A high-level language is any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.
A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing and register utilization.
High-level languages are designed to be used by the human operator or the programmer.
They are referred to as "closer to humans."
In other words, their programming style and context is easier to learn and implement than low-level languages,
and the entire code generally focuses on the specific program to be created.
A high-level language does not require addressing hardware constraints when developing a program.
However, every single program written in a high-level language must be interpreted into machine language before being executed by the computer.

C. Advantages and disadvantages of High-level-Programming

1. It is programmer friendly language.
2. High level language is less memory efficient.
3. It is easy to understand.
4. Debugging is easy.
5. It is simple to maintain.
6. It is portable.
7. It can run on any platform.
8. It needs compiler or interpreter for translation.
9. It is used widely for programming.


D. Python

a. Philosophy

1. The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters. 
2. Beautiful is better than ugly. 
3. Explicit is better than implicit. 
4. Simple is better than complex. 
5. Complex is better than complicated. 
6. Flat is better than nested.
7. Sparse is better than dense.
8. Readability counts.
9. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
10. Although practicality beats purity. 
11. Errors should never pass silently. 
12. Unless explicitly silenced.
13. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
14. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
15. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
16. Now is better than never.
17. Although never is often better than *right* now.
18. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
19. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. 
20. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
